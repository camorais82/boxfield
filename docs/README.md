# Boxfield

### Background
Boxfield is a remake of an old Flash game called Cubefield. The main draw of Boxfield is that it immerses the player in an ominous dark and retro environment (think Tron). The player is always moving forward and has to dodge obstacles. The game keeps track of the players score based on how long they have been alive for. The game does not end and the level gets repeated until an obstacle is hit.

- Player is continuously moving forward
- Player is able to sway left and right through arrow keys or A & D
- Obstacles are moving towards the player
